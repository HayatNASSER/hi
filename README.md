Dear Aguilera,


I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the LORIA laboratory, Nancy-France, under the direction of professor Isabelle Debled-Rennesson, and my research interests include shape representation, discrete geometry, discrete structures of digital curves and image analysis.


I'm interested in the results of your paper "E. J. Aguilera-Aguilera, A. Carmona-Poyato, F. J. Madrid-Cuevas, and R. Medina-Carnicer. The computation of polygonal approximations for 2d contours based on a concavity tree. Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 25 (8): 1905-1917, November 2014. ISSN 1047-3203. Doi: 10.1016 / j.jvcir.2014.09.012".


I'm making comparisons between your work and mine. I found on GitHub (https://github.com/eusebioaguilera/cdp) the paper code. I tried to find the result of the polygonal simplification for contours (example1.txt example2.txt example3.txt), and I found the result a little bit strange in parts of the curves (see result1.svg, result2.svg, result3.svg).

What do you think about these results? Can you send me your results (the detected points to calculate ours criteria for evaluations) to do the comparison?


Thank you in advance for your answer.


Best regards,

Hayat Nasser
